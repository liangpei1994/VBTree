Description: This package provides a new data structure, vector binary
  tree, to make your data visiting and management more efficient. if your
  data has very structurized column names, it can read these names and 
  factorize them through specific split pattern, then build the mappings
  within double list, vector binary tree, array and tensor mutually, through
  which the batched data processing is achievable easily. The methods of 
  array and tensor are also applicable.
